Project: Survey/Test Generator

The contained project allows users to create, display, load, store, take, modify, and tabulate custom surveys and tests.
Additionally, test items can be displayed with correct answers and graded based on those correct answers. The project
behaves as described in the provided requirements. There is certain behavior to highlight that was not explicitly
provided by the system requirements. Note that newly created surveys and tests must be stored manually. If a new survey
or test is created before saving the previously created questionnaire, that questionnaire will be lost. The system saves
questionnaires to their original filenames automatically after modification. The system also saves a questionnaire
automatically after the user takes it. This allows user responses to questions to be saved to questionnaires for ease of
tabulation (for both surveys and tests) and grading (for tests only). For tests, the filename associated with a user
response is automatically saved to the selected test to take. This allows for proper association between tests and their
corresponding response sets. In this project folder, there are some pre-generated items: 1 survey with 3 response sets,
2 tests with 2 response sets each, and 1 test with no response set. These are meant to encapsulate the bulk of the
possible functionality of this system.
